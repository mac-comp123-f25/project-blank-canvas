# Pomodoro Clock
What is this GitHub repository all about?
  The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on the principle of breaking down work into short, focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, called "Pomodoros." Each interval of intense, uninterrupted work is followed by a short 5-minute break, with a longer break taken after completing four Pomodoros. The core purpose of this cyclical system is to enhance mental focus and reduce fatigue by creating a sense of urgency while ensuring regular rest. By making large tasks feel more manageable and training you to handle distractions, the technique ultimately aims to combat procrastination, prevent burnout, and boost overall productivity.
