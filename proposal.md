## Description

Our team decided to create a Pomodoro Technique app—a simple timer for computers and iPads. The inspiration stems from how this timer helps individuals with ADHD or distractibility overcome focus issues. For instance, the clock automatically schedules a 5-minute break every 25 minutes, though users can customize both work and focus durations. Beyond basic timing, this software offers features not found in standard timers. Users can set to-do lists, track and review each session's duration, establish recurring habits and goals, and categorize tasks by priority level. This is a preliminary plan, with potential for further feature additions. The Pomodoro interface is customizable, featuring vibrant background options. Additionally, Pomodoro supports multiple languages.

## Inspirations Behind

Time is precious, the state of deep-work is extremely precious but also fragile. The core problem is not to work hard, but that our brain need a system to resist interference and focus on the present. So we want to design a “Pomodoro timing” program to help us improve the efficiency of work and study. “Pomodoro timing” has a simple method – 25 minutes concentration plus 5 minutes break. That's the cornerstone of time management. “Pomodoro timing” can reorganize the fragmented time into efficient productivity blocks. It can combat decision - making fatigue through force rest and maintain a long-term high efficiency of cognitive resources.

## Implementation and Responsibility plan

PM1 (due 11/7): Description (Bridgette), Inspiration Behind (Yuntong), Responsibility Plan (Leah)


PM2 (due 11/17): Every member reads an article, listens to a podcast, or watches a video about effective teamwork then summarizes it in the corresponding sheet in their progress tracker.


PM3 （due 11/21) : All team members brainstorm together about specific functions we can add to our pomodoro timer. Then, we use Figma to generate a prototype of the timer.


PM4 (due 12/5): Prepare slides for intro, goals and progress overview (Bridgette); Prepare slides for demo and technical progress (Leah); Prepare slides for next steps and feedback summary (Yuntong)


PM5 (due 12/10): Finalize core features and main program logic (Leah); Write the README.md, add screenshots and embedded video link (Yuntong); REview and clean up the code repository structure (Bridgette)
